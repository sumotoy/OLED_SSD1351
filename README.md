# OLED_SSD1351
A fast library for OLED drived by SSD1351
Early alpha version, perfectly working with Teensy 3.1 but NOT with avr's or other arms (wait beta).
SSD1351 works in SPI mode 3!!!! This mean it will be not so nice if other devices are connected in the same SPI bus, I'm investigating some simple workaround so stay tuned.
